## Process data:

Suppose the parallel corpus is placed at `../data/<dataset_name>`. The following script converts the parallel corpus into format read by the neural network:

`./train.sh --process_data --dataset <dataset_name>`

## Train the model:

The following script is a start to run experiments on the bash dataset:

`./bash-attn.sh`
