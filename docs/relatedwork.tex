\paragraph{Domain-Specific Natural Language Programming} The problem of translating natural language into executable code have been studied since decades ago~\cite{Ballard:1979:PNL:800177.810072,Pederson-Report}. Most of previous research prototyped on domain-specific languages, ranging from the Structured Query Language (SQL)~\cite{Nihalani_NLIDB_review} to text-editing commands for Office suite applications~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/DesaiGHJKMRR15}.

\paragraph{Semantic Parsing} A number of natural language processing (NLP) research were conducted with a special focus on molding natural language into programming tools~\cite{mihalcea2006nlp,LandhauBer:2015:TUP:2820668.2820671}. Besides, 
%the task of synthesizing programs from natural language meets the 
there is a surge of interest from the NLP community in mapping natural language into formal meaning representations~\cite{Zettlemoyer05learningto,artzi2013weakly,DBLP:Poon13,Kwiatkowski:2011:LGC:2145432.2145593,liang2013learning}. The task was broadly named semantic parsing. In the natural language (NL)-based program synthesis scenario, semantic parsing naturally becomes a crucial intermediate step, in which it maps natural language commands into the formal specification that program synthesis relies on.  Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled the adoption of more sophisticated linguistic representation, such as the combinatory categorical grammar (CCG)~\cite{opac-b1080082}, as a bridge between the natural language and the formal meaning representation. It also sheds light on more efficient parsing~\cite{lewis2015joint} and more effective machine learning algorithms which makes more efficient and precise NL-based program synthesis feasible.
%Compared to traditional syntactic parsing that maps natural language to its syntactic parse tree~\cite{Klein:2003:AUP:1075096.1075150}, semantic parsing. 
% Despite the development of linguistic-based semantic theory~\cite{dowty1989} and abstract meaning representation~\cite{Banarescu13abstractmeaning}, the majority of the semantic parsing frameworks were implanted in real-world applications
