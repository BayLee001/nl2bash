\section{Natural Language Based CLI Framework}

The natural language based command line interpreter we plan to develop consists of two key components: (1) an intermediate logic representation based on which Linux commands are generated and (2) a semantic parser that effectively maps the natural language commands issued by users to this intermediate logic representation. Especially, our initial pilot system is restricted to cover operations related to file system operations. We restrict the domain with the hope that it can be expressed with tractable logic as well as reducing the amount of ambiguity in the natural language command.
