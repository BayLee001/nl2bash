\autoref{fig:arch} shows the major components of our translation framework.
Offline, the tool learns the syntax of common Bash commands using manpages. Both
the manpages and input-output examples obtained from StackOverflow are used to
learn an appropriate scoring function. At runtime, the tool enumerates possible
candidate programs using the learned syntax, scores them using the learned
scoring function, and presents the top-ranked suggestions to the user.

Section~\ref{subsec:represent} introduces the subset of Bash our tool supports
and how we obtain that subset automatically from manpages.
Section~\ref{subsec:parser} describes training and running the semantic parser.
