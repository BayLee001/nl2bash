    \caption{The overall architecture of our tool. Offline, the tool learns the
        valid syntax for common Bash commands using manpages. Both the manpages
        and a set of input-output examples are used to learn an appropriate
        scoring function. At runtime, the tool enumerates possible candidate
        programs using the learned syntax, scores them using the learned scoring
        function, and presents the top-ranked suggestions to the user.}

The natural language to Linux command line translation framework we developed consists of two key components: 
1) an intermediate language to represent commands and
2) an algorithm that maps the natural language commands given by users to this intermediate representation. Our initial pilot system is restricted to cover only file system operations, including file lookup, directory tree transformation, file content transformation, and file property modifications. We restrict the domain in the hope that it can be expressed with tractable logic and to reduce the degree of ambiguity in the natural language command. Section~\ref{subsec:represent} introduces the formal language design---the subset of Bash our tool supports---and section~\ref{subsec:parser} introduces the approach to train the semantic parser.
