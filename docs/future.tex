\section{Future Work}

Automatically generating bash commands based on natural language descriptions is a non-trivial AI task that fuses both natural language processing and program synthesis techniques. We are planning to do the following works atop of the current framework.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}

Linux man pages are well formatted and contains rich natural language text that explains the usage of each command template and its possible arguments. We propose to use the command-explanation pairs extracted from man pages as additional signals to guide the search for high score rankings, thereby remedies the lack of well-formed training pairs.

\subsection{Modeling Richer Semantics}
\label{future:semantics}
\subsubsection{Argument Values}

\subsubsection{Compound Commands}

\subsubsection{Numeric and Ordinal Information}

\subsubsection{Domain Knowledge about the File System}

Maybe it's worth having some domain knowledge representation about 
file (name, date, size)
folder
subfolder
hidden file 
executable file
etc.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}

Difficult to get ground truth from general users. Should we host some sort of ``command line programming challenge'' to attract experts to write bash commands for our pre-selected natural language descriptions? How?

\subsection{Interactive Learning}
