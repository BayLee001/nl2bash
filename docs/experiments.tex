\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Dataset}

The online forum StackOverflow has a large volume of input/output pairs. As these conversations are noisy and only a handful of high-quality training pairs can be confidently extracted. On the other hand, Linux man pages are well formatted and contains rich natural language text that explains the usage of each command template and its possible arguments. We propose to use the command-explanation pairs extracted from man pages as additional signals to guide the search for high score rankings, thereby remedies the lack of well-formed training pairs.
