# NL2Bash

## Overview

This repository contains the data and source code release of the paper: [NL2Bash: A Corpus and Semantic Parser for
Natural Language Interface to the Linux Operating System](http://victorialin.net/pubs/nl2bash.pdf).

Specifically, it contains the following components:

1. A set of ~10,000 bash one-liners collected from websites such as StackOverflow paired with their English descriptions written by Bash programmers.
2. Tensorflow implementations of the following translation models:
   - the standard [Seq2Seq](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) and [CopyNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06393) models
   - a stage-wise NL‚ü∂Bash model using argument filling heuristics (Lin et. al. 2017).
3. A Bash command parser which parses a Bash command into an abstractive syntax tree, developed on top of  [bashlex](https://github.com/idank/bashlex).
4. A set of domain-specific natural language processing tools, including a regex-based sentence tokenizer and a domain specific named entity recognizer.

## Data Statistics

Our corpus contain a diverse set of Bash utilities and flags: 102 unique utilities, 206 unique flags and 15 reserved tokens. (Browse the raw data collection [here](https://github.com/TellinaTool/nl2bash/tree/master/data/bash).)

In our experiments, the set of ~10,000 NL-bash command pairs are splitted into train, dev and test sets such that *neither a natural language description nor a Bash command appears in more than one split*.

The statistics of the data split is tabulated below. (A command template is defined as a Bash command with all of its arguments replaced by their semantic types.)

<table>
   <tr>
      <td><strong>Split</strong></td>
      <td>Train</td>
      <td>Dev</td>
      <td>Test</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td># pairs</td>
      <td>8,090</td>
      <td>609</td>
      <td>606</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td># unique NL</td>
      <td>7,340</td>
      <td>549</td>
      <td>547</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td># unique command</td>
      <td>6,400</td>
      <td>599</td>
      <td>XX</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td># unique command template</td>
      <td>4,002</td>
      <td>509</td>
      <td>XX</td>
   </tr>
</table>

The frequency of the top 50 most frequent Bash utilities in the corpus is illustrated in the following diagram.

## Leaderboard

### Manually Evaluated Translation Accuracy

Top-k full command accuracy and top-k command template accuracy judged by human experts. Please refer to section 4 of the paper for the exact procedures we took to run manual evaluation.  

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>Model</td>
      <td>F-Acc-Top1</td>
      <td>F-Acc-Top3</td>
      <td>T-Acc-Top1</td>
      <td>T-Acc-Top3</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Sub-token CopyNet (this work)</td>
      <td><strong>0.36</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0.45</strong></td>
      <td>0.49</td>
      <td>0.61</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Tellina (Lin et. al. 2017)</td>
      <td>0.27</td>
      <td>0.32</td>
      <td><strong>0.53</strong></td>
      <td><strong>0.62</strong></td>
   </tr>
</table>

Please also refer to "Notes on Manual Evaluation" at the end of this readme for issues to keep in mind if you plan to run your own manual evaluation.

### Automatic Evaluation Metrics

In addition, we also report BLEU and a self-defined template matching score as the automatic evaluation metrics used to approximate the true translation accuracy. Please refer to appendix C of the paper for more details.

<table>
   <tr>
      <td>Model</td>
      <td>BLEU-Top1</td>
      <td>BLEU-Top3</td>
      <td>TM-Top1</td>
      <td>TM-Top3</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Sub-token CopyNet (this work)</td>
      <td><strong>50.9</strong></td>
      <td><strong>58.2</strong></td>
      <td>0.574</td>
      <td>0.634</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>

## Run Experiments

### Install TensorFlow

To reproduce our experiments, please install TensorFlow (>= 1.0). The experiments can be reproduced on machines with or without GPUs.

We suggest following the [official instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to install the library. The following pip installation command is copied from the official website and has been tested on Mac OS 10.10.5.
```
sudo pip3 install --upgrade \
 https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.3.0-py3-none-any.whl 
```

### Environment Variables & Dependencies

Once TensorFlow is installed, run `make` in the root directory of the repo. This sets up the Python path and main experiment dependencies.
```
(sudo) make
```

### Change Directory

Then enter the [experiments](/experiments) directory.
```
cd experiments
```
### Data filtering, split and pre-processing

Run the following command. This will clean the raw NL2Bash corpus and apply filtering, create the train/dev/test splits and preprocess the data into the formats taken by the Tensorflow models. 

```
make data
```
To change the data-processing workflow, go to [data](/data) and modify the utility scripts.

### Train the models
```
make train
```

### Generate evaluation table using pre-trained models

Decode the pre-trained models and print the evaluation summary table.
```
make decode
```

Skip the decoding step and print the evaluation summary table from the predictions saved on disk.
```
make gen_manual_evaluation_table
```

By default, the decoding and evaluation steps will print sanity checking messages. You may set `verbose` to `False` in the following source files to suppress those messages.
```
encoder_decoder/decode_tools.py
eval/eval_tools.py
```

### Notes on Manual Evaluation

In our experiment, we conduct manual evaluation as the correctness of a Bash translation cannot simply be determined by mapping it to a set of ground truth.
We suggest the following practices for future work to generate comparable results and to accelerate the development cycle.
1. If you plan to run your own manual evaluation, please annotate the output of both your system(s) and the baseline systems you compared to. This is to ensure that the newly proposed system(s) and the baselines are judged by the same group of annotators.
2. If you run your own manual evaluation, please release the examples you annotated with their annotations. This helps the community to replicate the results and future work could reuse these annotations.
3. During model development you could annotate a small subset of the dev examples (50-100 is likely enough) to estimate the true dev set accuracy. We released a script which saves any previous annotations and opens a commandline interface for judging any unseen predictions ([manual_eval.md](https://github.com/TellinaTool/nl2bash/blob/master/manual_eval.md)).

The motivation for the practices above is detailed in issue [#6](https://github.com/TellinaTool/nl2bash/issues/6).
