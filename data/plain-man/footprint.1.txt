FOOTPRINT(1)              BSD General Commands Manual             FOOTPRINT(1)

NAME
     footprint -- gathers memory information about one or more processes

SYNOPSIS
     footprint [-j] [-t] [-s] [-v] ( -a | <process name | pid> [ ... ] )
     footprint -h

DESCRIPTION
     The footprint utility gathers and displays memory consumption information
     for the specified processes.

     footprint will display all addressable memory used by the specified pro-
     cesses, but it emphasizes anonymous and wired memory.  If multiple pro-
     cesses are specified, footprint will de-duplicate multiply mapped objects
     and will display shared objects separately from private ones.

     Because it is inspecting the address space of other processes, footprint
     must be run as root.

OPTIONS
     -a      target all processes (will take much longer)

     -j      format output in JSON instead of structured text

     -t      in addition to the supplied processes, target their children,
             grandchildren, etc.

     -s      skip processes that are dirty tracked and have no outstanding XPC
             transactions (i.e., are "clean")

     -v      display vmmap-like output of address space layout

     -h      display help and exit
