NAME
     layerutil create compiled layered image stack

SYNOPSIS
     layerutil [-Vlho] inputfile

DESCRIPTION
     Creates a compiled layered image stack (lcr) file from a layered input
     file source, such as an lsr or suitably structured Photoshop (psd) file.

OPTIONS
     The following options are available:

     -c                Convert to lcr format.

     -l <n>, ---lossy-compression <n>
                       Set the lossy compression factor used for image content
                       to a value between 0 and 1.0, default is 0.75. The
                       smaller the value, the smaller the compressed file
                       size. A value of 1.0 creates a lossless image.

     -o, --output      Output file name. If no output file is given then the
                       basename of the input file is used as the output file
                       name with an appended .lcr extension.

     -h, --help        Prints out usage information.
