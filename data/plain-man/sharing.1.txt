SYNOPSIS
     sharing [-a <path> [options]] [-e <share point name> [options]]
             [-r <share point name>] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
     A list of flags and their descriptions:

     -a <path>
              add a new share point for the directory specified by <path>.

     -e <share point name>
              edit the share point record specified by <share point name>.

     -r <share point name>
              delete the share point record specified by <share point name>.

     -l       list all existing share point records.

     The following options modify share point record attributes:

     -A <afp name>
              use customized name <afp name> when using share point with afp.

     -F <ftp name>
              use customized name <ftp name> when using share point with ftp.

     -S <smb name>
              use customized name <smb name> when using share points with smb.

     -s <flags>
              Use this option to enable and disable sharing via afp, ftp, and
              smb.  By default a share point is enabled for afp, ftp, and smb
              protocols.  To enable and disable particular services, combine
              (binary AND) the following flags as required: 100 (enable shar-
              ing for afp), 010 (enable sharing for smb), and 001 (enable
              sharing for ftp).  Specify 000 to turn off sharing of a share
              point altogether.  Use a customized name <smb name> if appropri-
              ate when using share points with smb.

     -g <guest flag>
              Use this option to enable and disable guest access for afp, ftp,
              and smb.  By default guest access is enabled for afp, ftp, and
              smb.  To enable and disable guest access to particular services,
              combine (binary AND) the following flags as required: 100
              (enable guest for afp), 010 (enable guest for smb), and 001
              (enable guest for ftp).  Specify 000 to turn off guest access
              for a share point altogether.

     -i <inherit privileges flag>
              Use this option to enable and disable the "inherit privileges"
              attribute for afp, ftp, and smb.  By default "inherit privi-
              leges" is enabled for ftp only.  To enable and disable guest
              access to particular services, combine (binary AND) the follow-
              ing flags as required: 100 ("inherit privileges" for afp), 010
              ("inherit privileges" for smb), and 001 ("inherit privileges"
              for ftp).  Specify 000 to turn off "inherit privileges" for a
              share point altogether.

     -n <customized record name>
              Specify a <customized record name> to be used as the share point
              record name.  By default the record name is the name of the
              directory pointed to by the share point record.  This directory
              is specified bt the <path> when the record is created.
