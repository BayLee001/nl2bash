DH_GENCONTROL(1)                                      Debhelper                                     DH_GENCONTROL(1)



NAME
       dh_gencontrol - generate and install control file

SYNOPSIS
       dh_gencontrol [debhelper options] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_gencontrol is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating control files, and installing them
       into the DEBIAN directory with the proper permissions.

       This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-gencontrol(1), which calls it once for each package being acted
       on, and passes in some additional useful flags.

OPTIONS
       -- params
           Pass params to dpkg-gencontrol(1).

       -uparams, --dpkg-gencontrol-params=params
           This is another way to pass params to dpkg-gencontrol(1).  It is deprecated; use -- instead.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
