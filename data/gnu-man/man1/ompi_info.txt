OMPI_INFO(1)                                          Open MPI                                          OMPI_INFO(1)



NAME
       ompi_info - Display information about the Open MPI installation

SYNOPSIS
       ompi_info [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ompi_info provides detailed information about the Open MPI installation.  It can be useful for at least three
       common scenarios:

       1. Checking local configuration and seeing how Open MPI was installed.

       2. Submitting bug reports / help requests to  the  Open  MPI  community  (see  http://www.open-mpi.org/commu‐
       nity/help/)

       3. Seeing a list of installed Open MPI plugins and querying what MCA parameters they support.

OPTIONS
       ompi_info accepts the following options:

       -a|--all
               Show all configuration options and MCA parameters

       --arch  Show architecture Open MPI was compiled on

       -c|--config
               Show configuration options

       -gmca|--gmca <param> <value>
               Pass global MCA parameters that are applicable to all contexts.

       -h|--help
               Shows help / usage message

       --hostname
               Show the hostname that Open MPI was configured and built on

       --internal
               Show internal MCA parameters (not meant to be modified by users)

       -mca|--mca <param> <value>
               Pass  context-specific  MCA parameters; they are considered global if --gmca is not used and only one
               context is specified.

       --param <type> <component>
               Show MCA parameters.  The first parameter is the type of the component to display; the second parame‐
               ter  is  the  specific component to display (or the keyword "all", meaning "display all components of
               this type").

       --parsable
               When used in conjunction with other parameters, the output is displayed in a machine-parsable  format
               --parseable Synonym for --parsable

       --path <type>
               Show paths that Open MPI was configured with.  Accepts the following parameters: prefix, bindir, lib‐
               dir, incdir, pkglibdir, sysconfdir.

       --pretty
               When used in conjunction with other parameters, the  output  is  displayed  in  'prettyprint'  format
               (default)

       -v|--version <component> <scope>
               Show  version  of Open MPI or a component.  <component> can be the keywords "ompi" or "all", the name
               of a framework (e.g., "coll" shows all components in the coll framework), or the name of  a  specific
               component (e.g., "pls:rsh" shows the information from the rsh PLS component).  <scope> can be one of:
               full, major, minor, release, greek, svn.

EXAMPLES
       ompi_info
           Show the default output of options and listing of installed components in a human-readable /  prettyprint
           format.

       ompi_info --parsable
           Show the default output of options and listing of installed components in a machine-parsable format.

       ompi_info --param btl openib
           Show the MCA parameters of the "openib" BTL component in a human-readable / prettyprint format.

       ompi_info --param btl openib --parsable
           Show the MCA parameters of the "openib" BTL component in a machine-parsable format.

       ompi_info --path bindir
           Show the "bindir" that Open MPI was configured with.

       ompi_info --version ompi full --parsable
           Show  the  full  version  numbers of Open MPI (including the ORTE and OPAL version numbers) in a machine-
           readable format.

       ompi_info --version btl major
           Show the major version number of all BTL components in a prettyprint format.

       ompi_info --version btl:tcp minor
           Show the minor version number of the TCP BTL component in a prettyprint format.

       ompi_info --all
           Show all information about the Open MPI installation, including all components that can be found, the MCA
           parameters that they support, versions of Open MPI and the components, etc.
