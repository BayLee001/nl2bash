NAME
       Read - Read Target Test Chart.

DESCRIPTION
       Read  Target  Test  Chart,  Version  1.5.1  Author:  Graeme W. Gill, licensed under the AGPL Version 3 usage:
       chartread [-options] outfile

       -v     Verbose mode

       -c listno
              Set communication port from the following list (default 1)

              ** No ports found **

       -t     Use transmission measurement mode

       -d     Use display measurement mode (white Y relative results)

       -e     Emissive for transparency on a light box

       -p     Measure patch by patch rather than strip

       -x [lx]
              Take external values, either L*a*b* (-xl) or XYZ (-xx).

       -n     Don't save spectral information (default saves spectral)

       -l     Save CIE as D50 L*a*b* rather than XYZ

       -L     Save CIE as D50 L*a*b* as well as XYZ

       -r     Resume reading partly read chart

       -I file.cal
              Override calibration info from .ti2 in resulting .ti3

       -F filter
              Set filter configuration (if aplicable):

       n      None

       p      Polarising filter

       6      D65

       u      U.V. Cut

       -N     Disable initial calibration of instrument if possible

       -B     Disable auto bi-directional strip recognition

       -H     Use high resolution spectrum mode (if available)

       -X file.ccmx
              Apply Colorimeter Correction Matrix

       -X file.ccss
              Use Colorimeter Calibration Spectral Samples for calibration

       -Q observ
              Choose CIE Observer for CCSS instrument: 1931_2 (def), 1964_10, S&B 1955_2, shaw, J&V 1978_2

       -T ratio
              Modify strip patch consistency tolerance by ratio

       -S     Suppress wrong strip & unexpected value warnings

       -W n|h|x
              Override serial port flow control: n = none, h = HW, x = Xon/Xoff

       -D [level]
              Print debug diagnostics to stderr

       outfile
              Base name for input[ti2]/output[ti3] file
