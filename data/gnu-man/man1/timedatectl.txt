TIMEDATECTL(1)                                       timedatectl                                      TIMEDATECTL(1)



NAME
       timedatectl - Control the system time and date

SYNOPSIS
       timedatectl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       timedatectl may be used to query and change the system clock and its settings.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -h, --help
           Prints a short help text and exits.

       --version
           Prints a short version string and exits.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       --no-ask-password
           Don't query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       -H, --host
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or username and hostname separated by @, to connect
           to. This will use SSH to talk to a remote system.

       --adjust-system-clock
           If set-local-rtc is invoked and this option is passed the system clock is synchronized from the RTC
           again, taking the new setting into account. Otherwise the RTC is synchronized from the system clock.

       The following commands are understood:

       status
           Show current settings of the system clock and RTC.

       set-time [TIME]
           Set the system clock to the specified time. This will also update the RTC time accordingly. The time may
           be specified in the format "2012-10-30 18:17:16".

       set-timezone [TIMEZONE]
           Set the system time zone to the specified value. Available time zones can be listed with list-timezones.
           If the RTC is configured to be in the local time this will also update the RTC time. This call will alter
           the /etc/localtime symlink. See localtime(5) for more information.

       list-timezones
           List available time zones, one per line. Entries from the list can be set as the system time zone with
           set-timezone.

       set-local-rtc [BOOL]
           Takes a boolean argument. If 0 the system is configured to maintain the RTC in universal time, if 1 it
           will maintain the RTC in local time instead. Note that maintaining the RTC in the local time zone is not
           fully supported and will create various problems with time zone changes and daylight saving adjustments.
           If at all possible use RTC in UTC. Note that invoking this will also synchronize the RTC from the system
           clock, unless --adjust-system-clock is passed (see above). This command will change the 3rd line of
           /etc/adjtime, as documented in hwclock(8).

       set-ntp [BOOL]
           Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether NTP based network time synchronization is enabled (if
           available).

EXIT STATUS
       On success 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

ENVIRONMENT
       $SYSTEMD_PAGER
           Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER. Setting this to an empty string or the value
           cat is equivalent to passing --no-pager.

EXAMPLES
       Show current settings:

           $ timedatectl
                 Local time: Fri, 2012-11-02 09:26:46 CET
             Universal time: Fri, 2012-11-02 08:26:46 UTC
                   RTC time: Fri, 2012-11-02 08:26:45
                   Timezone: Europe/Warsaw
                 UTC offset: +0100
                NTP enabled: no
           NTP synchronized: no
            RTC in local TZ: no
                 DST active: no
            Last DST change: CEST → CET, DST became inactive
                             Sun, 2012-10-28 02:59:59 CEST
                             Sun, 2012-10-28 02:00:00 CET
            Next DST change: CET → CEST, DST will become active
                             the clock will jump one hour forward
                             Sun, 2013-03-31 01:59:59 CET
                             Sun, 2013-03-31 03:00:00 CEST


       Enable an NTP daemon (chronyd):

           $ timedatectl set-ntp true
           ==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.timedate1.set-ntp ===
           Authentication is required to control whether network time synchronization shall be enabled.
           Authenticating as: user

           $ systemctl status chronyd.service
           chronyd.service - NTP client/server
                     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/chronyd.service; enabled)
                     Active: active (running) since Fri, 2012-11-02 09:36:25 CET; 5s ago
