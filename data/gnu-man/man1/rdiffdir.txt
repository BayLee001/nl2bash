NAME
       rdiffdir - compute and apply signatures and diffs to directories

SYNOPSIS
       rdiffdir [options] sig[nature] basis_dir signature_file

       rdiffdir [options] delta full_sigtar {incr_sigtar} new_dir delta_file

       rdiffdir [options] patch basis_dir delta_file

       rdiffdir [options] tar basis_dir tar_file

       If  signature_file  or delta_file are "-", the data will be read from stdin or written to stdout as appropri‐
       ate.


DESCRIPTION
       rdiffdir is supposed to be like rdiff, but can operate on directories.  See rdiff(1)  for  more  information.
       The syntax is similar.

       Regarding  the  delta command, the full_sigtar operand is a signature_file written by an earlier signature or
       tar command (the latter using the --write-sig-to option). The optional  incr_sigtar  operands  are  signature
       files  written  by earlier delta commands using the --write-sig-to option. This way the Nth invocation of the
       delta command can parse (and extend) the signature chain that has been founded by the first signature or  tar
       command  with  a  full  signature, and then extended by the subsequent N-1 delta invocations with incremental
       signatures. It is the responsibility of the user to specify the sigtar operands in logical increment order.


OPTIONS
       --write-sig-to sigfile
              This option is only used in delta and tar modes.  When specified, rdiffdir will write a  signature  of
              the  directory it is processing to sigfile.  The end result will be a delta and a new signature calcu‐
              lated over the same data.


       -z, --gzip-compress
              Enable gzip compression and decompression of signature and delta files.


SELECTION OPTIONS
       In signature and  delta  modes,  rdiffdir  accepts  duplicity-like  selection  options  including  --exclude,
       --exclude-filelist-stdin, etc.  See the duplicity(1) manual page for more information.


BUGS
       Hard links are currently unsupported (they will be treated as non-linked regular files).

       Bad signatures will be treated as empty instead of logging appropriate error message.
