NAME
       nm-applet — Network management framework

SYNOPSIS
       nm-applet

DESCRIPTION
       nm-applet is the GNOME front-end for NetworkManager

       It  is  a  systray applet which will display an icon in GNOME's notification area but it also works for other
       desktop environments which provide a systray like KDE or XFCE.

       nm-applet shows a list of available networks and allows you to easily switch between them. For encrypted net‐
       works it will prompt you for the key/passphrase and you can optionally store them in the gnome-keyring so you
       don't have to type them again.

SEE ALSO
       NetworkManager(8), nm-tool(1)
