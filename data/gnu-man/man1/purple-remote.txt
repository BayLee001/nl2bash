PURPLE-REMOTE(1)                               General Commands Manual                              PURPLE-REMOTE(1)



NAME
       purple-remote - Send remote commands to Pidgin/Finch

SYNOPSIS
       purple-remote command1 command2 ...

OPTIONS
       Each command is of one of the three types:

       [protocol:]commandname?param1=value1&param2=value2&...
       FunctionName?param1=value1&param2=value2&...
       FunctionName(value1,value2,...)

       The  second and third form are provided for completeness but their use is not recommended; use purple-send or
       purple-send-async instead.  The second form uses introspection to find out  the  parameter  names  and  their
       types, therefore it is rather slow.


EXAMPLES
       jabber:goim?screenname=testone@localhost&message=hi
       jabber:gochat?room=TestRoom&server=conference.localhost
       jabber:getinfo?screenname=testone@localhost
       jabber:addbuddy?screenname=my friend

       setstatus?status=away&message=don't disturb
       quit

       PurpleAccountsFindConnected?name=&protocol=prpl-jabber
       PurpleAccountFindConnected(,prpl-jabber)
