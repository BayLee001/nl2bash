       -v level
              Verbosity level 0 - 2 (default = 1)

       -g     Plot slice instead of looking colors up. (Default white to black)

       -G s:L:a:b
              Override plot slice start with Lab or Jab co-ordinate

       -G e:L:a:b
              Override plot slice end with Lab or Jab co-ordinate

       -f function
              f = forward, b = backwards, g = gamut, p = preview if = inverted forward, ib = inverted backwards

       -i intent
              a = absolute, r = relative colorimetric p = perceptual, s = saturation

       -o order
              n = normal (priority: lut > matrix > monochrome) r = reverse (priority: monochrome > matrix > lut)

       -p oride
              x = XYZ_PCS, X = XYZ * 100, l = Lab_PCS, L = LCh, y = Yxy j = CIECAM02 Appearance Jab,  J  =  CIECAM02
              Appearance JCh

       -s scale
              Scale device range 0.0 - scale rather than 0.0 - 1.0

       -k [zhxrlv]
              Black  value  target: z = zero K, h = 0.5 K, x = max K, r = ramp K (def.)  l = extra PCS input is por‐
              tion of K locus v = extra PCS input is K target value

       -k p stle stpo enpo enle shape

              stle: K level at White 0.0 - 1.0 stpo: start point of transition Wh 0.0 - Bk 1.0 enpo:  End  point  of
              transition  Wh  0.0  - Bk 1.0 enle: K level at Black 0.0 - 1.0 shape: 1.0 = straight, 0.0-1.0 concave,
              1.0-2.0 convex

       -k q stle0 stpo0 enpo0 enle0 shape0 stle2 stpo2 enpo2 enle2 shape2

              Transfer extra PCS input to dual curve limits

       -K parameters
              Same as -k, but target is K locus rather than K value itself

       -l tlimit
              set total ink limit, 0 - 400% (estimate by default)

       -L klimit
              set black ink limit, 0 - 100% (estimate by default)

       -a     show actual target values if clipped

       -u     warn if output PCS is outside the spectrum locus

       -m     merge output processing into clut

       -b     use CAM Jab for clipping

       -c viewcond
              set viewing conditions for CIECAM97s, either an enumerated choice, or a parameter:value changes

              Adaptation luminance in cd.m^2 (default 50.0)

              Background % of image luminance (default 20)

              Flare light % of image luminance (default 1)

       f:X:Y:Z
              Flare color as XYZ (default media white, Abs: D50)

       f:x:y  Flare color as x, y

              The colors to be translated should be fed into standard in, one input color per line, white space sep‐
              arated.  A line starting with a # will be ignored.  A line not starting with a number  will  terminate
              the program.  Use -v0 for just output colors.
