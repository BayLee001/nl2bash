WEAVE(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      WEAVE(1)



NAME
       weave - translate WEB to TeX

SYNOPSIS
       weave [-x] webfile[.web] [changefile[.ch]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The weave program is used to create a TeX file for viewing a Web program.  It takes appropriate care of typo‐
       graphic  details like page layout and the use of indentation, italics, boldface, etc., and it supplies exten‐
       sive cross-index information that it gathers automatically.  The command line arguments are the same  as  for
       tangle  except  for the option: -x says to omit the index, module name list, and table of contents pages.  (A
       CONTENTS.tex file will still be written when the TeX file is processed, however, unless some macros  in  web‐
       mac.tex are redefined.)

       The output TeX file name is formed by adding .tex to the root of the Web file name.

       There  are  several  macros  that  probably should be redefined by the programmer at the beginning of the Web
       file.  It is a good idea to set \title to the name of the program.  And, to cause output of only changed mod‐
       ules, one can say \let\maybe=\iffalse (usually as the first change in the change file).

ENVIRONMENT
       The  environment variable WEBINPUTS is used to search for the input files, or the system default if WEBINPUTS
       is not set.  See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

FILES
       $TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/webmac.tex
           TeX macros used by weave output.
