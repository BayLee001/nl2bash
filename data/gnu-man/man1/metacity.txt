NAME
       METACITY - minimal GTK2 Window Manager

SYNOPSIS

       sion] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly metacity.

       metacity is a minimal X window manager aimed at nontechnical users and is designed to integrate well with the
       GNOME  desktop.   metacity  lacks  some  features that may be expected by traditional UNIX or other technical
       users; these users may want to investigate other available window managers for use with GNOME or standalone.

OPTIONS
       --display=DISPLAY
              Connect to X display DISPLAY.

       --replace
              a window manager which is running is replaced by metacity.  Users are encouraged to change  the  GNOME
              window  manager  by  running the new WM with the --replace or -replace option, and subsequently saving
              the session.

       --sm-client-id=ID
              Specify a session management ID.

       --sm-disable
              Disable the session management.

       --sm-save-file=FILENAME
              Load a session from FILENAME.

       --version
              Print the version number.

       -?, --help
              Show summary of options.

CONFIGURATION
       metacity configuration can be found under Preferences->Windows and  Preferences->Keyboard  Shortcuts  on  the
       menu-panel. Advanced configuration can be achieved directly through gsettings.
