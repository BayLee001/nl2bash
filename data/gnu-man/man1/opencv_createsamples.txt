NAME
       opencv_createsamples - create training and testing samples



SYNOPSIS
       opencv_createsamples [options]



DESCRIPTION
       opencv_createsamples creates positive samples from a single object image or a collection of positive images.

       The scheme of test samples creation is similar to training samples creation since each test sample is a back‐
       ground image into which a randomly distorted and randomly scaled instance of the object picture is pasted  at
       a random position.


OPTIONS
       opencv_createsamples supports the following options:


       -info collection_file_name
              A database of positive source images. Use it together with -img to create test samples instead.


       -img image_file_name
              A positive source image. Use it together with -info to create test samples instead.


       -vec vec_file_name
              The output file name containing the generated positive samples for training.


       -bg background_file_name
              The  background  description  file  (the negative sample set). It contains a list of images into which
              randomly distorted versions of the object are pasted for positive sample generation.


       -num number_of_samples
              The number of positive samples to generate/train. The default is 1000.


       -bgcolor background_color
              The background color (currently grayscale images are assumed); the background color denotes the trans‐
              parent color. The default is 0.


       -inv   Invert the colors.



       -maxidev max_intensity_deviation
              The desired maximum intensity deviation of foreground samples pixels. The default is 40.


       -maxxangle max_x_rotation_angle
              The maximum rotation angle in x-direction in radians. The default is 1.1.


       -maxyangle max_y_rotation_angle
              The maximum rotation angle in y-direction in radians. The default is 1.1.


       -maxzangle max_z_rotation_angle
              The maximum rotation angle in z-direction in radians. The default is 0.5.


       -show [scale_factor]
              Show  each  created  sample  during  the  creation  process. Optionally a scaling factor can be
              defined. The default is 4.0.

              If <ESC> is pressed, the creation process will continue without showing the samples.  This  can
              be useful for debugging purposes.


       -h sample_height
              For the creation of training samples, it is the resulting sample height.  The default is 24.

              In case of creating test samples, it is the minimal height of placed object picture.


       -w sample_width
              For the creation of training samples, it is the resulting sample width.  The default is 24.

              In case of creating test samples, it is the minimal width of placed object picture.


       The same information is shown, if opencv_createsamples is called without any arguments/options.



EXAMPLES
       To create training samples from one image applying distortions and show the results:

              opencv_createsamples -img source.png -num 10 -bg negatives.dat -vec samples_out.vec -show

       To create training samples of size 40x40 from some images without applying distortions:

              opencv_creasamples -info source.dat -vec samples_out.vec -w 40 -h 40
