OPENCV_PERFORMANCE(1)                               User Commands                              OPENCV_PERFORMANCE(1)



NAME
       opencv_performance - evaluate the performance of the classifier



SYNOPSIS
       opencv_performance [options]



DESCRIPTION
       opencv_performance  evaluates  the  performance  of  the  classifier. It takes a collection of marked up test
       images, applies the classifier and outputs the performance, i.e. number of found objects,  number  of  missed
       objects, number of false alarms and other information.

       When  there  is  no  such  collection  available  test samples may be created from single object image by the
       opencv_createsamples(1) utility. The scheme of test samples creation in this case is similar to training sam‐
       ples

       In the output, the table should be read:

       'Hits' shows the number of correctly found objects

       'Missed'
              shows the number of missed objects (must exist but are not found, also known as false negatives)

       'False'
              shows the number of false alarms (must not exist but are found, also known as false positives)



OPTIONS
       opencv_performance supports the following options:


       -data classifier_directory_name
              The directory, in which the classifier can be found.


       -info collection_file_name
              File with test samples description.


       -maxSizeDiff max_size_difference
              Determine the size criterion of reference and detected coincidence.  The default is 1.500000.


       -maxPosDiff max_position_difference
              Determine the position criterion of reference and detected coincidence.  The default is 0.300000.


       -sf scale_factor
              Scale the detection window in each iteration. The default is 1.200000.


       -ni    Don't save detection result to an image. This could be useful, if collection_file_name contains paths.


       -nos number_of_stages
              Number of stages to use. The default is -1 (all stages are used).


       -rs roc_size
              The default is 40.


       -h sample_height
              The sample height (must have the same value as used during creation).  The default is 24.


       -w sample_width
              The sample width (must have the same value as used during creation).  The default is 24.


       The same information is shown, if opencv_performance is called without any arguments/options.



EXAMPLES
       To create training samples from one image applying distortions and show the results:

              opencv_performance -data trainout -info tests.dat
