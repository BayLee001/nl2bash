NAME
       usb_modeswitch_dispatcher - wrapper for usb_modeswitch, not intended for direct invocation.

SYNOPSIS
       usb_modeswitch_dispatcher

DESCRIPTION
       usb_modeswitch_dispatcher  will  do  detailed  device  checking  and will subsequently use the usb_modeswitch
       binary together with the selected device config file to switch the mode of certain USB devices.

       If no drivers are taking care of the device after the mode switch, the dispatcher will try to load  and  bind
       the "option" serial driver, in order to make the device useable.

       This program is called by udev and is not supposed to be called directly by the user.

SEE ALSO
       usb_modeswitch(1).
