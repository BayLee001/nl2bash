DESCRIPTION
       Note: The javaws command is not available on Oracle Solaris.

       The javaws command starts Java Web Start, which is the reference implementation of the JNLP. Java Web Start
       starts Java applications and applets hosted on a network.

       If a JNLP file is specified, then the javaws command starts the Java application or applet specified in the
       JNLP file.

       The javaws launcher has a set of options that are supported in the current release. However, the options may
       be removed in a future release.

RUN-OPTIONS
       -offline
              Runs Java Web Start in offline mode.

       -Xnosplash
              Does not display the initial splash screen.

       -open arguments
              When specified, this option replaces the arguments in the JNLP file with -openarguments.

       -print arguments
              When specified, this option replaces the arguments in the JNLP file with -printarguments.

       -online
              Uses online mode. This is the default behavior.

       -wait
              The javaws process does not exit until the application exits. This option does not function as
              described on Windows platforms.

       -verbose
              Displays additional output.

       -Joption
              Passes option to the Java Virtual Machine, where option is one of the options described on the
              reference page for the Java application launcher. For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48
              MB. See java(1).

       -system
              Runs the application from the system cache only.

       -codebase url
              Retrieves resources from the specified codebase.

       -shortcut
              Installs shortcuts if the user allows a prompt. This option has no effect unless the -silent option is
              also used.
