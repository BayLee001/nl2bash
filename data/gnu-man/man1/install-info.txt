INSTALL-INFO(1)                                General Commands Manual                               INSTALL-INFO(1)



NAME
       install-info - wrapper around GNU install-info

SYNOPSIS
       install-info [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the install-info command.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       GNU/Linux distribution because the original script was designed for Debian packaging system.

       install-info is a wrapper around GNU install-info. If it is called from a normal shell or script it acts like
       GNU install-info by forwarding all options to ginstall-info.

       If  it is called from a maintainer script it gives a warning to rebuild packages and does nothing, since info
       file installation is now done via triggers.

OPTIONS
       Same as with GNU install-info, see ginstall-info(1).
