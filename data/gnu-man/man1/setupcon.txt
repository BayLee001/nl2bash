NAME
       setupcon - sets up the font and the keyboard on Linux console

SYNOPSIS
       setupcon [ option ]... [ variant ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       setupcon is a program for fast and easy setup of the font and the keyboard on the Linux console.

OPTIONS
       -k, --keyboard-only
              Setup the keyboard only, do not setup the font.

       -f, --font-only
              Setup the font only, do not setup the keyboard.

       --force
              Do  not  check  whether we are on the console.  Notice that you can be forced to hard-reboot your com‐
              puter if you run setupcon with this option and you are on a X server.

       -v, --verbose
              Be more verbose.   Use this option if something goes wrong.

       --save If you want to use setupcon early in the boot process, it is possible that /usr is not yet mounted and
              the  required  data are not available.  This option makes setupcon copy the required data in /etc/con‐
              sole-setup in order to make it available before /usr is mounted.  If you use  setupcon  early  in  the
              boot process, then use this option whenever you change the console configuration.

       --save-only
              Same  like  --save,  but do not setup the keyboard and the font.  This option can be useful if you run
              setupcon in a X server.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information.

       variant
              Specifies which configuration file  to  use.   By  default  the  configuration  file  of  setupcon  is
              /etc/default/console-setup  but  if you use e.g. "chukchi" as variant then the configuration file will
              be /etc/default/console-setup.chukchi.  This allows you to have several different configurations - for
              example  one  for the Chukchi language and another in /etc/default/console-setup for your default con‐
              figuration.

BASIC USAGE
       Most of the time you invoke setupcon without arguments.  Please look at the README file for more information.
