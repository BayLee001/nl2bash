NAME
       intel_upload_blit_large_gtt - microbenchmark of Intel GPU performance

SYNOPSIS
       intel_upload_blit_large_gtt

DESCRIPTION
       intel_upload_blit_large_gtt is a microbenchmark tool for DRM performance.  It should be run with kernel mode‚Äê
       setting enabled, and may require root privilege for correct operation.  It does not require X to be running.

       Given that it is a microbenchmark, its utility is largely for regression testing of the kernel, and  not  for
       general conclusions on graphics performance.
