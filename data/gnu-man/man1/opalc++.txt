OPAL_WRAPPER(1)                                       Open MPI                                       OPAL_WRAPPER(1)



NAME
       opal_wrapper - Back-end Open MPI wrapper command

SYNOPSIS
       opal_wrapper [options]

DESCRIPTION
       opal_wrapper is not meant to be called directly by end users.  It is automatically invoked as the back-end by
       the Open MPI wrapper commands such as: mpicc, mpiCC, mpic++, mpif77, and mpif90.

       Some Open MPI installations may have additional wrapper commands, and/or have renamed the  wrapper  compilers
       listed  above  to  avoid  executable name conflicts with other MPI implementations.  Hence, you may also have
       wrapper compilers installed including the following names:  mpif90.openmpi,  mpif77.openmpi,  mpicxx.openmpi,
       mpiCC.openmpi, mpicc.openmpi, mpic++.openmpi, opalcc, opalc++, ortecc, and ortec++,

SEE ALSO
       The  following  may  exist depending on your particular Open MPI installation: mpicc(1), mpiCC(1), mpic++(1),
       mpif77(1), mpif90(1), mpif90.openmpi(1), mpif77.openmpi(1), mpicxx.openmpi(1), mpiCC.openmpi(1),  mpicc.open‚Äê
       mpi(1), mpic++.openmpi(1), ortecc(1), ortec++(1), opalccc(1), and the website at http://www.openmpi.org/.
