NAME
       dh_installexamples - install example files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installexamples [debhelper options] [-A] [-Xitem] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installexamples is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing examples into
       usr/share/doc/package/examples in package build directories.

FILES
       debian/package.examples
           Lists example files or directories to be installed.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Install any files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages acted on.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being installed.

       file ...
           Install these files (or directories) as examples into the first package acted on. (Or into all packages
           if -A is specified.)

NOTES
       Note that dh_installexamples will happily copy entire directory hierarchies if you ask it to (similar to cp
       -a). If it is asked to install a directory, it will install the complete contents of the directory.
