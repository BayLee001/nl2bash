       glade-gtk2 - GUI Builder for GTK+ 2

SYNOPSIS
       glade-gtk2 [options] file

DESCRIPTION
       Glade  allows a graphical interface to be designed from within a graphical interface, instead of written as a
       program using a function or class library.

       The creation of various GTK graphical "widgets" is supported, allowing a programmer to concentrate on  imple‚Äê
       mentation of an applications functionality, instead of the presentation.

       --display=DISPLAY
