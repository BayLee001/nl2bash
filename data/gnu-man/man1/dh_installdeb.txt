DH_INSTALLDEB(1)                                      Debhelper                                     DH_INSTALLDEB(1)



NAME
       dh_installdeb - install files into the DEBIAN directory

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installdeb [debhelperÂ options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installdeb is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing files into the DEBIAN directories in
       package build directories with the correct permissions.

FILES
       package.postinst
       package.preinst
       package.postrm
       package.prerm
           These maintainer scripts are installed into the DEBIAN directory.

           Inside the scripts, the token #DEBHELPER# is replaced with shell script snippets generated by other
           debhelper commands.

       package.triggers
       package.shlibs
           These control files are installed into the DEBIAN directory.

       package.conffiles
           This control file will be installed into the DEBIAN directory.

           In v3 compatibility mode and higher, all files in the etc/ directory in a package will automatically be
           flagged as conffiles by this program, so there is no need to list them manually here.

       package.maintscript
           Lines in this file correspond to dpkg-maintscript-helper(1) commands and parameters.  Any shell
           metacharacters will be escaped, so arbitrary shell code cannot be inserted here.  For example, a line
           such as "mv_conffile /etc/oldconffile /etc/newconffile" will insert maintainer script snippets into all
           maintainer scripts sufficient to move that conffile.
