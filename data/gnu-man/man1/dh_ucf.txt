DH_UCF(1)                                             Debhelper                                            DH_UCF(1)



NAME
       dh_ucf - register configuration files with ucf

SYNOPSIS
       dh_ucf [debhelperÂ options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_ucf is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the postinst and postrm commands that
       register files with ucf(1) and ucfr(1).

FILES
       debian/package.ucf
           List pairs of source and destination files to register with ucf. Each pair should be put on its own line,
           with the source and destination separated by whitespace. Both source and destination must be absolute
           paths. The source should be a file that is provided by your package, typically in /usr/share/, while the
           destination is typically a file in /etc/.

           A dependency on ucf will be generated in ${misc:Depends}.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts. Turns this command into a no-op.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
