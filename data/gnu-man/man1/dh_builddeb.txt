NAME
       dh_builddeb - build Debian binary packages

SYNOPSIS
       dh_builddeb [debhelper options] [--destdir=directory] [--filename=name] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_builddeb simply calls dpkg-deb(1) to build a Debian package or packages.

       It supports building multiple binary packages in parallel, when enabled by DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

OPTIONS
       --destdir=directory
           Use this if you want the generated .deb files to be put in a directory other than the default of "..".

       --filename=name
           Use this if you want to force the generated .deb file to have a particular file name. Does not work well
           if more than one .deb is generated!

       -- params
           Pass params to dpkg-deb(1) when it is used to build the package.

       -uparams
           This is another way to pass params to dpkg-deb(1).  It is deprecated; use -- instead.
