NAME
       asy - script-based vector graphics language

SYNOPSIS
       xasy  [-x magnification] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Asymptote  is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language for technical drawing, inspired by MetaPost but
       with an improved C++-like syntax.  Asymptote provides for figures the same high-quality level of  typesetting
       that LaTeX does for scientific text.

       xasy is a GUI for Asymptote that allows for final figure adjustments.


OPTIONS
       -x magnification
              Initial zoom.
