NAME
       dh_suidregister - suid registration program (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       Do not run!

DESCRIPTION
       This program used to register suid and sgid files with suidregister(1), but with the introduction of
       dpkg-statoverride(8), registration of files in this way is unnecessary, and even harmful, so this program is
       deprecated and should not be used.

CONVERTING TO STATOVERRIDE
       Converting a package that uses this program to use the new statoverride mechanism is easy. Just remove the
       call to dh_suidregister from debian/rules, and add a versioned conflicts into your control file, as follows:

         Conflicts: suidmanager (<< 0.50)

       The conflicts is only necessary if your package used to register things with suidmanager; if it did not, you
       can just remove the call to this program from your rules file.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
