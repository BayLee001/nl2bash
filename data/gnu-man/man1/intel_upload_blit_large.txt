NAME
       intel_upload_blit_large - microbenchmark of Intel GPU performance

SYNOPSIS
       intel_upload_blit_large

DESCRIPTION
       intel_upload_blit_large  is a microbenchmark tool for DRM performance.  It should be run with kernel modeset‚Äê
       ting enabled, and may require root privilege for correct operation.  It does not require X to be running.

       Given that it is a microbenchmark, its utility is largely for regression testing of the kernel, and  not  for
       general conclusions on graphics performance.
